# UserIcon Component

The `UserIcon` component is a React component designed to display a user icon or a login link based on the user's authentication status. It also provides a logout functionality.

## Usage

### Importing

```jsx
import UserIcon from 'path-to-UserIcon';
```

### Example

```jsx
//...

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <UserIcon />
      {/* Other components or content */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

## Component Overview

The `UserIcon` component consists of the following elements and functionalities:

1. **Conditional Rendering:**
    - If a user is authenticated (`user` is truthy), it displays a user icon with the first two characters of the user's ID.
    - If the user is not authenticated, it displays an `AccountCircle` icon as a link leading to the login page.

2. **Logout Functionality:**
    - When the user is authenticated, clicking on the user icon triggers the logout functionality, which clears the user information.

3. **Login Link:**
    - When the user is not authenticated, the `AccountCircle` icon serves as a link that redirects to the login page when clicked.

## Component Code Explanation

- `store` is used to access the user data and the `clear` function from the store (assumed to be a global state management store).

- `user` is the user object obtained from the store.

- The `clear` function is used to clear the user data when logging out.

- The `logout` function is triggered when the user clicks on the user icon, prompting a confirmation dialog before clearing the user data.

- The user icon or login link is rendered based on the authentication status of the user.
