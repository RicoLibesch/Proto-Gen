The `Roles` component is a React functional component designed for managing user roles in an admin interface. It provides functionalities for assigning and removing roles such as "Administrator" and "Recorder" to users. The component utilizes functions from the `@/utils/API` module to handle backend API calls.

## Dependencies

- `useEffect` and `useState` from React for managing component lifecycle and state.
- `AdminHeader` from "@/components/AdminHeader" for rendering the admin header.
- `StringList` from "@/components/StringList" for managing lists of users with roles.
- `getUsers`, `removeRole`, `setRole` functions from `@/utils/API` for handling backend API calls.
- `react-toastify` for displaying toast messages.

## Usage

The `Roles` component can be used within an admin interface of a Next.js application for managing user roles.

```jsx
import Roles from '@/components/Roles';

const RolesAdminPage = () => {
  return <Roles />;
};

export default RolesAdminPage;
```

## State

- **admins**: Holds an array of user IDs with the "Administrator" role.
- **recorder**: Holds an array of user IDs with the "Recorder" role.
- **users**: Holds an array of all users.

## Methods

- **deleteAdmin(index: number)**: Removes the "Administrator" role from the user at the specified index in the `admins` array.
- **deleteRecorder(index: number)**: Removes the "Recorder" role from the user at the specified index in the `recorder` array.
- **addAdmin(value: string)**: Adds the "Administrator" role to the user with the specified ID.
- **addRecorder(value: string)**: Adds the "Recorder" role to the user with the specified ID.
- **save()**: Placeholder for a method that would save changes made to roles.

## UI Structure

The UI structure of the `Roles` component consists of a grid layout with two columns. Each column represents a role:
1. **Administrators**: Allows users to manage the list of users with the "Administrator" role.
2. **Recorders**: Allows users to manage the list of users with the "Recorder" role.

Each role section utilizes the `StringList` component for listing users, allowing additions and deletions.

## Styling

The component uses Tailwind CSS for styling, providing a clean and responsive design. Additional styling can be applied based on project requirements.
