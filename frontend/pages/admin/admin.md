## Dependencies

- `useRouter` from Next.js for programmatic navigation.
- `useEffect` from React for handling side effects.

## Usage

The `AdminPanel` component is intended to be used within an admin interface of a Next.js application. It automatically redirects the user to a specified admin page upon mounting.

```jsx
import AdminPanel from '@/components/AdminPanel';

const AdminInterfacePage = () => {
  return <AdminPanel />;
};

export default AdminInterfacePage;
```

## Behavior

Upon mounting, the `useEffect` hook triggers the `router.push("/admin/logo")` statement, redirecting the user to the specified admin page. The `return <div></div>;` statement is included to satisfy the requirements of a valid React component.

## Styling

The component itself does not include any specific styling, as its primary purpose is to handle the redirection logic. Styling considerations may be applied based on the overall design and requirements of the admin interface.

This documentation provides an overview of the `AdminPanel` component, its dependencies, usage, behavior, and styling considerations. Adjustments can be made based on specific project requirements and additional functionality.
