# App Component Documentation

The `App` component is the main entry point for your Next.js application. It wraps each page with a common layout (`Layout` component) and is responsible for rendering the application's UI.

## Dependencies

- `Layout` component: The `Layout` component appears to be a custom component used for creating a common layout structure across multiple pages.
- `@/styles/globals.css`: Global styles for the entire application.

## Usage

The `App` component is typically located in the `pages/_app.tsx` or `pages/_app.js` file, depending on your project structure. It receives `Component` and `pageProps` as its props and wraps the `Component` with the `Layout` component.

```jsx
// pages/_app.tsx or pages/_app.js

import "@/styles/globals.css";
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
import Layout from "./Layout";

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

## Props

- `Component`: Represents the current page component that should be rendered.
- `pageProps`: Contains the props specific to the current page being rendered.

## Layout

The `Layout` component is not provided here, but it's assumed to define the overall structure and styling of the application layout, such as headers, footers, or any common UI elements shared across multiple pages.

## Styling

Global styles are applied to the entire application through the `@/styles/globals.css` file. Styling considerations may include defining typography, colors, spacing, and other global styles that should be consistent across all pages.

This documentation provides an overview of the `App` component, its dependencies, usage, props, and general styling considerations. Adjustments can be made based on specific project requirements and additional styling or functionality.
